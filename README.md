# ReactExample

An adaption of the standard React tutorial comments app. I've added bootstrap, extra fields and had a go at customising the markup in the Jsx. 

Bootstrap slots in just fine - just need to replace the class attributes with classname. Style attribute doesn't work properly, but the accepted practice is to always use css classes.
